            <p>Hi! My name is Spencer Caretta and I am currently attending the UMN Coding Boot Camp. I hope to learn many things about building websites especially how to add cool functions with javascript.</p>
            <p>Secondarily, I am hoping to learn some basics to be able to make different application for both PC and Mobile devices.  I think there will be lots of exciting things to learn in this course, and I cannot wait to see what all I have learned by the end of the course.</p>
